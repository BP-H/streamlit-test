# Symbolic Token Voting

The governance system supports weighted votes using symbolic tokens. Each vote
optionally includes a `token_amount` field representing the quantity of
`SymbolicToken` the voter commits. When computing consensus, these token weights
multiply the normal reputation or time-decay factors.

Tokens are purely for experimentation and have **no real-world value**. See the
main README for legal disclaimers. Weighted voting allows richer simulation of
stake-based decision making without any monetary component.
